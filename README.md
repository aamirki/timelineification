# Timelineification

## Description

Timelineification is a daily game where five facts about events that happened
from different years are presented, and the user is tasked with putting them
in order. The facts are taken from the `Events` section of Wikipedia year
articles.

It is a daily game in the style of Wordle, so the idea is that each day every
user on earth will get the same puzzle.

## Running

Run `npm start dev` to run the project locally.
